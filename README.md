# log-extractor
A simple log tool of extracting some basic information.

# the core problems to solve
- the VLOOKUP function is extreamly slow or even blocked when merging such a number of data 60,000 * 60,000.

# The Plan
- Parse logs with the blocks not only lines.
- Ouput data into a file with Excel format directly.
